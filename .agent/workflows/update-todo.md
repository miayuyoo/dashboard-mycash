description: Update the project TO-DO list based on completed tasks
---

1. Read the file `docs/TODO.md` to see the current status of tasks.
2. Based on the work completed in the current and recent turns (check the conversation history and edited files), identify which PROMPTS or tasks have been fully implemented.
3. Update `docs/TODO.md` by changing `[ ]` to `[x]` for the completed items.
4. Briefly verify that the implementation matches the description in the TODO item before marking it as done.
